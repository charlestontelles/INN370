/**
 * A train is a sequence of carriages. This class defines various operations
 * that can be performed to prepare a long-distance train for departure.
 * 
 * We assume that a train can be assembled from any available rolling stock,
 * including locomotives, passenger cars and freight cars. However, they may be
 * configured in only a certain sequence:
 * 
 * The first carriage must be a locomotive (and there can be only one locomotive
 * per train). This may be followed by zero or more passenger cars. These may be
 * followed by zero or more freight cars.
 * 
 * Any other configurations of rolling stock are disallowed.
 * 
 * The process of preparing the train for departure occurs in two stages:
 * 
 * The train is assembled from individual carriages. New carriages may be added
 * to the rear of the train only. (Similarly, carriages may be removed from the
 * rear of the train only.) Passengers board the train. For safety reasons, no
 * carriage shunting operations may be performed when any passengers are on
 * board the train.
